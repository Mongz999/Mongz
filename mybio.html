        <h1>All About Me</h1>
        <p> My name means “God is with us.” This powerful name is mentioned multiple times in Scripture,
            reminding us of God's constant presence in our lives. In our family we have 2 puppy named Kiera and Kingkang. 
            I am currently living with my mother and grandmother. I would describe myself as being very introverted and quiet and also 
            very independent person. I am an interesting, fun loving guy with a good sense of humor. 
            One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once 
            I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. It is hard for me to make friends but once I make them, 
            it's great and I am all different. I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give. I am a very kind, compassionate, 
            sensitive guy as my close friends will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. I believe that friendship is one 
            of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. 
            I appreciate friendship and people who surround me. Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only 
            in the subjects but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy. I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk. 
            I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. 
            I always update myself with the news. I dislike a lot of things, to be quite honest. I generally dislike anything that has to do with zombies, 
            horror movies,talking to people, traffic,and being bored. I think some of my strengths would be my independence, calmness, and kindness.
            I am pretty calm in most situations, I try to not let things stress me out too much and I tend to be very laid back. 
            Some weaknesses I have is I am not so strong physically, I am very quiet, I am a procrastinator, and I am a overthinker. 
            I wish I was more physically stronger, so I can defend myself in case I ever get attacked out of nowhere one day. 
            I tend to be very quiet when talking to people. I'm trying to overcome it, but it's a very difficult process for me.
            It's really hard for me not to overthink. I'm trying to control my thoughts more, and not let it get to me so much. 
            I want to be a more confident, successful person.
